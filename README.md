Cistercian number counter for the arduboy!

Cistercian numbers are a way to represent values from 0-9999 while only taking up the space of a single character.

They are composed of quadrants along a vertical line, the line itself representing zero. the top right quadrant is units, left is ten, bottom right is hundreds, and bottom left is thousands. It may sound confusing, but once you look at it you'll find the patterns make a lot of sense and you'll quickly become accustomed to it. To that end, I made this game to show numbers with a cistercian numeral version on the right, and arabic on the left. The code itelf is something of interest as well, as it demonstrates how numbers are added ontop of each other to create numbers like 5,7,8, and 9.
